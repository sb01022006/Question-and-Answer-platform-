<br>
This is the PowerPoint presentation of our Question and Answer Platform which includes complete explanation of the project and contains the modular level design of the project.

## Overview

The **QUESTION AND ANSWER PLATFORM** is a lightweight and efficient solution for handling Q&A functionalities. It is implemented entirely in the **C programming language**, providing high performance and portability. 

This platform is suitable for:
- **Educational purposes**: Facilitating knowledge-sharing in academic environments.
- **Community-driven Q&A forums**: Enabling users to ask and answer questions in an organized manner.
- **Technical support platforms**: Providing a structured way to handle user queries and responses.

## Features

- **Question Management**: Add, delete, and manage questions.
- **Answer Management**: Submit and view answers for questions.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for questions or answers based on keywords.
- **User Management**: Manage user profiles and activity (optional, if implemented in the future).
- **Lightweight**: Implemented in pure C for performance and efficiency.
- **Customizable**: Designed to be extended with additional features.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this platform, you will need:

1. A **C compiler** (e.g., `gcc`).
2. A **terminal** or command-line interface.
3. Basic knowledge of **C programming** and Makefiles (if using one).

## Installation of OpenSSL Libraries (`-lssl` and `-lcrypto`)

To build and run the **server** and **client** applications, you need to install the OpenSSL development libraries, which provide the `-lssl` and `-lcrypto` functionality for cryptographic operations like password hashing.

### üì¶ Installing OpenSSL Libraries

#### On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

#### On RedHat/CentOS/Fedora-based systems, install the OpenSSL development package by running:

```bash
sudo dnf install openssl-devel
```

#### To install OpenSSL on Arch Linux, run:

```bash
sudo pacman -S openssl
```

#### Make sure you also have the GCC compiler and pthreads library available. Most systems include these by default, but if needed, on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems you can install them with:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

## Compiling and Running

üîß **Compiling the Server**  
Use the following command to compile `server.c`:

```bash
gcc -o server server.c -lssl -lpthread -lcrypto
```

- -lssl: Links against the OpenSSL SSL library.
- -lcrypto: Links against the OpenSSL cryptographic library.
- -lpthread: Enables POSIX threading support.

üîß **Compiling the Client**  
Use the following command to compile `client.c`:

```bash
gcc -o client client.c -lpthread
```
- -lpthread: Enables POSIX threading support for concurrent operations.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Running the Server and Client**  
Once compiled:

Start the server (in one terminal):

```bash
./server
```

Start the client (in another terminal):

```bash
./client
```


## Usage

1. **Launching the Platform**:
   Run the compiled executable to start the platform.

2. **Adding Questions**:
   Follow the on-screen instructions to add new questions.

3. **Answering Questions**:
   Select a question and provide answers as prompted.

4. **Searching**:
   Use the search feature to look for specific questions or answers.

5. **Exiting**:
   Use the appropriate menu option to exit the platform safely.
